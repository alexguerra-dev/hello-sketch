# hello-sketch

This is where I am going to start setting up my environment to play around with p5js.

- [ ] Add the prettier file
- [ ] Reformat all the files in the plugin project
- [ ] Check and see if the autocomplete is working.
- [ ] Setup vscode
  - [ ] Fonts

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your web browser and start editing `sketch.js`.

## Running Locally

For projects with media files, use a local server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx http-server

# Using VS Code Live Server extension
# Right-click index.html -> "Open with Live Server"
```
