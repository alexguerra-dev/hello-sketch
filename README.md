This is where I am going to start setting up my environment to play around with p5js.

- [x] Add the prettier file
- [x] Reformat all the files in the plugin project
- [x] Check and see if the autocomplete is working.
- [ ] Setup vscode
  - [ ] Fonts (I used monaspace [repo](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace))
  - [ ] Setup Theme
    - [x] Currently playing with Monokai Vibrant
    - [ ] Could also look into cat
  - [ ] Remove the indicator that shows changes to the file in the gutter
- [ ] Add _data_ to the `assets` folder
  - [ ] text files
    - [ ] ff7 guides
      - [ ] Battle Mechanics
      - [ ] Enemy Mechanics
      - [ ] Party Mechanics
