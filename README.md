This is where I am going to start setting up my environment to play around with p5js.

- [x] Add the prettier file
- [ ] Reformat all the files in the plugin project
- [ ] Check and see if the autocomplete is working.
- [ ] Setup vscode
  - [ ] Fonts (I used monaspace [repo](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace))
  - [ ] Setup Theme
    - [ ] Currently playing with Monokai Vibrant
    - [ ] Could also look into cat
